# Thank you for choosing me!

If you're reading this message, you most likely chose my service on Fiverr. Thank you for choosing me! This GitHub page (TimBot 909) is a repository for storing all the source code and information I need to run your bot, including your application's token, your Discord ID (don't worry, I don't keep this) and any other personalization you might want in your bot.

## If you want to host your bot...

I host my bots using Heroku. During the process, I will need you to create your account on Heroku and finish all the required steps to get your bot online, 24/7.

## If you want to run your bot...

You can just let Heroku run the bot. However, if you want to start locally, make sure you have node.js and npm installed. Once you do, type `npm run start`.

## If you have any questions...

Please feel free to contact me on Discord, **Tim Honks#0808**
