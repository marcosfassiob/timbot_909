This GitHub page (TimBot 909) is a repository for storing all the source code and information I need to run your bot, including your application's token, your Discord ID (don't worry, I don't keep this) and any other personalization you might want in your bot.

I host my bots using Heroku. During the process, I will need you to create your account on Heroku and finish all the required steps to get your bot online, 24/7.
